#aws-app

I am coverving aws basics in this projects and adding basic structures with learning different resource creation and maintaince with possible optimized cost.

Project Structure: 
  1. aws-stack: It will cover different type of creation of different resources in aws. e.g. Creating auto-scale instances using cloudformation or creating codepipeline using codepipeline, codedeploy, git etc.
  2. other directories will include different application development using aws like S3, Dynamodb or deploying serverless application using Lambda.
