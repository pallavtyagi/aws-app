# aws-app

I am coverving aws basics in this projects and adding basic structures with learning different resource creation and maintaince with possible optimized cost.

## Project Structure: 
  **aws-stack**: It will cover different type of creation of different resources in aws. e.g. Creating auto-scale instances using cloudformation or creating codepipeline using codepipeline, codedeploy, git etc.
  
  **other directories** will include different application development using aws like S3, Dynamodb or deploying serverless application using Lambda.
